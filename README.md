###D3 + IPython widgets

Sticky is a framework for easily integrating IPython widgets with D3 libraries. 

Why
-------
Because the IPython widgets and comms give us a very convenience communication layer between Python and D3. This allows for dynamic data upating and potential for other fun things, like linked charts where the data filtering happens in Python.

Status
-------
The most alpha of alpha. There are no tests yet. d3plus charts have strange updating behavior. 

Experimentation invited, production highly discouraged.
