###D3 + IPython widgets

Sticky is a framework for easily integrating IPython widgets with D3 libraries. 

Why
-------
Because the IPython widgets and comms give us a very powerful communication layer between Python and D3. This allows for dynamic data updating and the potential for other fun things, such as linked chart brushing where brush events trigger Python data filtering. 

Status
-------
The most alpha of alpha. There are no tests yet. d3plus charts have strange updating behavior. 

Experimentation invited, production highly discouraged.
